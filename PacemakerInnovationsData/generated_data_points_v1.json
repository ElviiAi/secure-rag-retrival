However, we did identify some areas for improvement, such as enhancing our waste management system and improving ventilation in certain production areas.\n\nWe have also established an incident reporting system that allows employees to report any EHS-related incidents or near-misses anonymously. This will help us track trends and take proactive measures to prevent future incidents.\n\nIn addition to the audit and incident reporting, we are launching a comprehensive training program for all manufacturing staff on EHS best practices and regulations. The program includes modules on hazard identification, risk assessment, and emergency response procedures. We believe that by empowering our employees with this knowledge, we can create a safer and more environmentally responsible workplace.",
